Geospatial analysis has seen significant growth in recent years, finding applications in 
several fields such as earth science, commerce, urban planning, and healthcare. An active 
area of research within this discipline involves anomaly detection, focusing on identifying 
unexpected behaviors or patterns that deviate from the norm. This project explores the 
application of unsupervised learning techniques to discern anomalies in spatial mobility 
within major prisons in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The primary goal is to uncover 
the extent of illegal smartphone usage within confined areas, which poses potential security 
threats.
The datasets used in this project are large but have limited attributes. Due to privacy 
reasons, all movements outside the target boundary are generalized using random offset. 
We integrated the use of conventional and machine learning approaches to build more
features from local information to apply in anomaly detection. Setting a conditional expected 
daily behavior using rule-based method and assessing its consistency and frequency inside 
the target location using statistics created movement characteristics that established pattern 
abnormalities. Applying K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering provided output 
clusters that learned from multiple inherent and engineered features.
The findings reveal irregular spatial patterns detected from devices within the prison vicinity 
during unconventional hours. The Gericino Complex shows heightened activity from April to 
July 2020, while CPD Pinheiros recorded increased movements in 2019 and the latter half of 
2020. Usage typically surges after 8 p.m. and diminishes post-midnight at both 
penitentiaries. While clustering helps visually identify abnormal movements, the cluster 
quality output from both clustering models is moderately good with room for improvements.
Future works using advanced modelling techniques can provide additional insights on 
precise and distinctive temporal and spatial dynamics within prison environments. These can 
help improve authority investigation and intervention strategies to address potential safety 
and security risks
